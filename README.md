Jalangi
=======
### Introduction

Jalangi is a framework for writing heavy-weight dynamic analyses for JavaScript.  Jalangi incorporates two key techniques:
1) selective record-replay, a technique which enables to record and to faithfully replay a user-selected part of the program, and
2) shadow values and shadow execution, which enables easy implementation of heavy-weight dynamic analyses.  In the distribution
you will find several analyses:

  * concolic testing,
  * an analysis to track origins of nulls and undefined,
  * an analysis to infer likely types of objects fields and functions,
  * an analysis to profile object allocation and usage,
  * a simple form of taint analysis,
  * an experimental pure symbolic execution engine (currently undocumented)

An evaluation of Jalangi on the SunSpider benchmark suite and on five web applications shows that
Jalangi has an average slowdown of 26X during recording and 30X slowdown during replay and analysis. The slowdowns are comparable with slowdowns reported for similar
tools, such as PIN and Valgrind for x86 binaries.

A demo of Jalangi integrated with the Tizen IDE is available at http://srl.cs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/jalangi.html.  Note that the IDE plugin is not open-source.
Slides are available at http://srl.cs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/slides/jalangi-jstools13.pdf and
our paper on Jalangi is available at http://srl.cs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/papers/jalangi.pdf.

### Requirements

We tested Jalangi on Mac OS X 10.8.  Jalangi should work on Mac OS
10.7, Ubuntu 11.0 and higher and Windows 7 or higher.

  * Latest version of Node.js available at http://nodejs.org/.  We have tested Jalangi with Node v0.8.22 and v0.10.3.
  * Sun's JDK 1.6 or higher.  We have tested Jalangi with Java 1.6.0_43.
  * Command-line git.
  * libgmp (http://gmplib.org/) is required by cvc3.  Concolic testing uses cvc3 and automaton.jar for constraint solving. The installation script checks if cvc3 and automaton.jar are installed properly.
  * Chrome browser if you need to test web apps.
  * Python (http://python.org) version 2.7 or higher
  
On Windows you need the following extra dependencies:

  * Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Free express version is fine).
  * If on 64bit also install Windows 7 64-bit SDK.

If you have a fresh installation of Ubuntu, you can install all the requirements by invoking the following commands from a terminal.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
    sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-7-oracle
    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install libgmp10
    sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

### Installation

    python ./scripts/install.py

If Installation succeeds, you should see the following message:

    ---> Installation successful.
    ---> run python scripts/sym.py to make sure all tests pass

A Lubuntu virtual machine with pre-installed jalangi can be downloaded from http://srl.cs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/jalangi4.zip.
You need VirtualBox available at https://www.virtualbox.org/ to run the virtual machine.
Login and password for the jalangi account on the machine are jalangi and jalangi, respectively.
Open a terminal, go to directory jalangi, and try ./scripts/testsym.

### Run Tests

    python ./scripts/sym.py

### Other Scripts

Run no analysis and check if record and replay executions produce same output on some unit tests located under tests/unit/.

    python ./scripts/units.py

Run no analysis and check if record and replay executions produce same
output on the sunspider benchmarks located under
tests/sunspider1/.

    python scripts/testsp.py

Run likely type inference analysis on the sunspider benchmarks located under tests/sunspider1/.

    python scripts/testsp_likelytype.py

Run tracker of origin of null and undefined on the sunspider benchmarks located under tests/sunspider1/.

    python scripts/testsp_tracknull.py

Run a simple heap profiler on the sunspider benchmarks located under tests/sunspider1/.

    python scripts/testsp_heapprofiling.py

Record an execution of tests/unit/qsort.js and create jalangi_trace.html which when loaded in a browser replays the execution.

    ./scripts/browserReplay tests/unit/qsort; path-to-chrome-browser jalangi_trace.html


### Concolic testing

To perform concolic testing of some JavaScript code present in a file,
say testme.js, insert the following 4 lines at the top of the file.

    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
        require('../../src/js/InputManager');
        require(process.cwd()+'/inputs');
    }

In the code, use J$.readInput(arg) to indicate the inputs to the
program.  Then run the following command to perform concolic testing:

    python scripts/jalangi.py concolic -i 100000 testme

The -i argument bounds the total number of test inputs.  The
command generates a set of input files in the directory jalangi_tmp.
The input files start with the prefix jalangi_inputs.  Once the inputs
are generated, you can run testme.js on those inputs by giving the
following command:

     python scripts/jalangi.py rerunall testme

For example, open the file tests/unit/qsort.js and check how inputs are specified.  Then run

     python scripts/jalangi.py concolic tests/unit/qsort 100
     python scripts/jalangi.py rerunall tests/unit/qsort


Open the file tests/unit/regex8.js and check how string inputs are specified.  Then run

     python scripts/jalangi.py concolic tests/unit/regex8 100
     python scripts/jalangi.py rerunall tests/unit/regex8


### Dynamic analysis

The JavaScript code in
src/js/analyses/objectalloc/ObjectAllocationTrackerEngine.js
implements a simple analysis that reports the number of objects
created during an execution along with some auxiliary information.
The analysis can be performed on a file testme.js by invoking the
following command:

    python scripts/jalangi.py analyze -a analyses/objectalloc/ObjectAllocationTrackerEngine testme

For example, try running the analysis on a sunspider benchmark by issuing the following command:

    python scripts/jalangi.py analyze -a analyses/objectalloc/ObjectAllocationTrackerEngine tests/sunspider1/crypto-aes

Similarly, you can run a likely type inference analysis on another sunspider benchmark by calling the following command and you will notice some warnings.

    python scripts/jalangi.py analyze -a analyses/likelytype/LikelyTypeInferEngine tests/sunspider1/crypto-sha1

Run the following to perform a simple form of taint analysis.

	python scripts/jalangi.py analyze -a analyses/simpletaint/SimpleTaintEngine tests/sunspider1/crypto-sha1

You can run origin of null and undefined tracker on a toy example by issuing the following command:

    python scripts/jalangi.py analyze -a analyses/trackundefinednull/UndefinedNullTrackingEngine tests/unit/track_undef_null

### Record and replay a web application.

***

First start a HTTP server by running the following command.  The command starts a simple Python based http server.

	python scripts/jalangi.py server &

Then instrument the JavaScript files that you want to analyze.  You also need to modify index.html so that it loads some library files and the instrumented files.

    node src/js/instrument/esnstrument.js tests/tizen/annex/js/annex.js

Finally launch the jalangi server and the html page by running

    python scripts/jalangi.py rrserver http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/tizen/annex/index_jalangi_.html

You can now play the game for sometime.  Try two moves.  This will generate a jalangi_trace1 in the current directory.  You can run a dynamic analysis on the trace file by issuing the following commands.

    export JALANGI_MODE=replay
    export JALANGI_ANALYSIS=analyses/objectalloc/ObjectAllocationTrackerEngine
    node src/js/commands/replay.js jalangi_trace1
