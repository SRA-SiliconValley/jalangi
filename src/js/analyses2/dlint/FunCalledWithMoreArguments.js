// In the following callbacks one can choose to not return anything.
// If all of the callbacks return nothing, we get a passive analysis where the
// concrete execution happens unmodified and callbacks are used to observe the execution.
// Once can choose to return suitable objects with specified fields in some callbacks
// to modify the behavior of the concrete execution.  For example, one could set the skip
// field of an object returned from putFieldPre to true to skip the actual putField operation.
// Similarly, one could set the result field of the object returned from a write callback
// to modify the value that is actually written to a variable. The result field of the object
// returned from a conditional callback can be suitably set to change the control-flow of the
// program execution.  In functionExit and scriptExit,
// one can set the isBacktrack field of the returned object to true to reexecute the body of
// the function from the beginning.  This in conjunction with the ability to change the
// control-flow of a program enables us to explore the different paths of a function in
// symbolic execution.
